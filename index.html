              Hi folks! My name is Pavan Thanay. I am currently a 3rd year CSE iMtech student at IIITB. I from Hyderabad. I like to play Tennis and know interesting solutions for some real life problems. I love watching movies.
            </p>
            <p>
              Science is something that interests me a lot. I am very inquisitive by nature. I am curious and always want to know why things are happening the way they are happening.

        <h2>My Experience with Online Learning</h2>
        <h3>Covid Lockdown Times</h3>
        <div class="about__content">
          <div>
            <p>
              New-age problems require new solutions. As the world knows, people from all walks of life have been suddenly affected due to the Covid 19 pandemic. The lives of many people all over the world have come to a standstill. Students and professionals are one class of people who have been hit the worst due to this shock. But we live in an age where technology rules and now it has given us a reasonable solution to the existing challenge.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a student, I have been affected due to this change and that too at one of the most crucial and critical times of my life. Luckily, online learning is a breather for me. I have taken lessons related to JEE over zoom and have just begun to attend virtual lectures of my professional college. In my opinion, virtual learning is the best existing option in the present situation. My transition to virtual learning was not smooth but I was assisted by my teachers and professors. The interaction in an online environment may not be as effective as real time interaction but it matches to real time interaction to a decent level.
            </p>
            <p>
              Initially, I faced a lot of challenges. I looked up to internet, read articles and tried to learn and understand how I can interact efficiently, with minimal discomfort, with people whom I have never met in my life. This has improved the way I use internet and changed my perspective about the social media platforms. Google has become one of my most indispensable weapons in recent times. 
            </p>
            <p>
              When in school or college, I tried to clear doubts with the help of my teachers, seniors or peers. But now, although I can interact with people over telephone or video conferencing, I find that it is not so satisfying as before. So, this situation has affected by attitude positively and now I look for online resources of information and study for improving myself and clearing my queries. I have realized that self-help is the best help.
            </p>
            <p>
              But that does not mean that I keep myself isolated from people. I try to interact as much as possible. By learning to interact proficiently over online platforms, I have just begun to improve my skills in communication and language. I have begun to interact with people whom I would have otherwise not talked with if the conditions were normal. I have learnt meaningful things by reconnecting with my peers and seniors. I have adopted methods for a good mental health.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the most important lessons that I have learnt from this experience is to be self-motivated, disciplined and persistent in my efforts because although the virtual world offers a good alternative solution to the existing problem, there is much stuff on the internet to keep one distracted and lose focus on one's goals. I have realized that I must get adapted to this condition rather than complaining about it. It will definitely take time to fully adjust to this situation. Many people are facing challenges trying to adjust to 'the new normal' but I am sure that we all will be able to overcome this hardship, sooner or later.
